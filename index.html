  <h2>👩‍💻 About Me</h2>
  <p>
    Hello! I'm Spurthy, a 2nd-year full-stack development student with a big love for creating, exploring, and learning new tech skills.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm especially interested in data science, building interactive web apps, and solving real-world problems through code. I enjoy making fun, user-friendly tools that others can enjoy too.
  </p>
  <p>
    Outside of coding, I'm curious, creative, and always excited to try something new – from designing blogs to building quiz games and more!

  <h2>📘 My Learning Journey</h2>
  <p>
    My coding journey started with curiosity and a love for solving puzzles. I began by learning Python basics and slowly started experimenting with small projects like calculators and simple games.
  </p>
  <p>
    As I explored more, I discovered Streamlit and built my first fun quiz app. Every error I faced taught me something new, making me more confident day by day.
  </p>
  <p>
    I believe in learning by doing, and each small project adds a stepping stone towards becoming a better developer.

  <h2>🧪 How My Fun Quiz App Works</h2>
  <p>
    My <strong>Fun Quiz App</strong> asks you 21 fun and surprising questions from random topics — general knowledge, fun facts, and brain teasers.
  </p>
  <p>
    For each one, you choose your answer and get instant feedback! At the end, it shows your total score and a cheerful message to motivate you.
  </p> 
  <p>
    It’s simple, clean, and made with ❤️ using Python & Streamlit.
